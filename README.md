## Gameplay

In zKube, players face the task of managing a grid populated by falling blocks. After each player turn, a new line of blocks appears at the bottom of the grid. Players can then strategically slide any block horizontally to arrange them in a manner that clears lines. Clearing a line rewards players with points, and bonus points are awarded for clearing multiple lines simultaneously. However, the challenge intensifies as the grid fills up, requiring players to think critically about each move to prevent the grid from reaching capacity. With its emphasis on thoughtful decision-making and puzzle-solving, zKube promises an immersive gameplay experience that will keep players engaged for hours on end.
